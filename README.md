## The Angular Router In Depth Course

This repository contains the code of the course [Angular Router In Depth](https://angular-university.io/course/angular-router-course).

# Installation pre-requisites

Please use Node 18 long-term support (LTS) version.

# Installing the Angular CLI

With the following command the angular-cli will be installed globally in your machine:

    npm install -g @angular/cli

# To Run the Development Backend Server

In order to be able to provide realistic examples, we will need in our playground a small REST API backend server. We can start the sample application backend with the following command:

    npm run server

This is a small Node REST API server.

# To run the Development UI Server

To run the frontend part of our code, we will use the Angular CLI:

    npm start

The application is visible at port 4200: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
